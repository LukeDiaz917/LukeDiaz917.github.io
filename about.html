              I’m a Miami-based student engineer focused on robotics, mechanical design, and hands-on manufacturing. I co-lead my school’s FTC/FRC teams and have interned in research and industry, from metal additive manufacturing to civil and production workflows. My goal is to build and optimize complex mechanical systems that actually work in the real world.
